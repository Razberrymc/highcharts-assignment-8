  <h1>Census Income Statistics</h1>

  <h2>By Michael Clark</h2>

  <p>In the United States, the census is conducted every 10 years. While the census collects data on the amount of people living in the U.S., information pertaining to the average American's quality of life can be derived from the data collected as well. For example, the household median income is not the same for everyone, and depending on age, can differ greatly. The same can be said for other social factors. Collected data can also reveal how the household median income has changed over the course of nearly a decade for different racial and ethnic groups. Essentially, the census is a valuable asset in identifying trends that reveal more than just population. </p>
